# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Utilizing Google Collabortatory, Amazon Web Services and PgAdmin this analysis will analyze a dataset of Amazon product reviews. The first step will be extracting the data, in this case we will be examining reviews of toys from the [Amazon Review datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). Using Pyspark in Google collaboratory the dataset will be read into a DataFrame to find the relative data. Then it will be transformed and reordered into into new DataFrames and uploaded to the SQL server.
