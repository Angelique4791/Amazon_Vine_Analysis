# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Utilizing Google Collabortatory, Amazon Web Services and PgAdmin this analysis will analyze a dataset of Amazon product reviews to determine a positive or negative bias. The first step will be extracting the data, in this case we will be examining reviews of toys from the [Amazon Review datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). Using Pyspark in Google collaboratory the dataset will be read into a DataFrame to find the relative data. Then it will be transformed and reordered into into new DataFrames and uploaded to the SQL server. There wil be four tables used to determine the bias of the reviews: review_id_table, customers_table, products_table, and the vine_table.
